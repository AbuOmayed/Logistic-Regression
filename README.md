<h1>Logistic Regression Projec:t</h1><br>
This repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression is widely employed in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

Overview
In this project, we implement logistic regression from scratch using Python and NumPy. We demonstrate its application on a synthetic dataset for binary classification. Additionally, we provide examples of how to use logistic regression for real-world datasets.

Key Features
Logistic Regression Implementation: Our implementation includes the core logic of logistic regression, including the sigmoid function, cost function, gradient descent optimization, and model evaluation metrics.
Example Usage: We provide examples of how to use logistic regression for binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.
Documentation: Detailed comments and documentation are provided within the codebase to aid understanding and usage.
Modularity: The codebase is organized into modular components, making it easy to extend and integrate into other projects.
Performance Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using metrics such as accuracy, Confusion_matrix,Jaccard Index, precision, recall, and F1-score.
